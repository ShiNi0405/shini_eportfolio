<h2>ðŸŒŸ Reflection</h2>  
 <h3> ðŸ“˜ Summarizing What I Have Gained From This </h3>
<h4>I learned what is the basic component inside a computer CPU.I also learned how to 
  install and uninstall components from the CPU.
</h4>

 <h3>ðŸ’¡Suggestions for Improvement </h3>
<h4>To improve,I suggest that more elaboration is given to different components of the 
CPU and how it affect the performance of the computer.So that we know what kind of 
hardware configurations we need for our use and computational need.</h4>

 <h3> ðŸ¤”Personal Reflections and Ideas  </h3>
<h4>HAHAHA It is so fun installing and uninstalling all the components.It feels like I 
can go to sell computers the next day.</h4>
