<h2>ðŸŒŸ Reflection</h2>  
 <h3> ðŸ“˜ Summarizing What I Have Gained From This </h3>
<h4>What I have gained is that there is a lot of people's hardwork inside the network that 
we take for granted.The team behind all of the technology we use is way more complicate
than we imagined.I had an rough overview of how is the organisational structure of an 
IT company and their environment,including different job scopes for UI/UX design,
development,IT helpdesk etcetera.</h4>

 <h3>ðŸ’¡Suggestions for Improvement </h3>
<h4>To improve,I suggest that we can go to more well knowned company outside of UTM like 
Google,Microsoft et cetera.UTM Digital can also give industrial projects for students
to develop their experience.</h4>

 <h3> ðŸ¤”Personal Reflections and Ideas  </h3>
<h4>The environment is so chill.I think I am going to enjoy a lot when I work.It is not
as bad as I imagine.</h4>
