 <h3>ðŸ’¡Suggestions for Improvement </h3>
<h4>To improve,I suggest that instead of teaching so many jargons with slides.Each chapter
  should focus on just 1 issue and let student explore them.The slides that has
  many words can be replaced with intuitive and interesting short videos.
  The syllabus should be up-to-date and explore the newest and most advanced issues 
  in computer science.

  lives.I am so excited to be able to study related with computer science in this
