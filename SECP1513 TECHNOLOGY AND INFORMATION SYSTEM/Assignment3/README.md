 <h2>ðŸŒŸ Reflection</h2>  
 <h3> ðŸ“˜ Summarizing What I Have Gained From This </h3>
<h4>I learned that there is a huge mismatch of what universtiy have learned versus the 
skills that is in demand in the market.A student gaining 4.0 cgpa doens't guarantee 
hers/ his a good job.A good student should, aside his/hers studies polish on the skills
  that market demands and build up his/hers portfolio.He /She should also honing on the soft
  skills like communication and presentation skills.The biggest surprise I get from the papers is that as an IT graduate,
a graduate with some extent of business acumen is a big plus plus.</h4>

 <h3>ðŸ’¡Suggestions for Improvement </h3>
<h4>To improve in this assignment,I should constantly alert to what my groupmates need and
be responsible of the work that I am passing to other groupmates.It should be correct and complete
  before I passed it on.I should also be more independent in term of how I carries my duties.
</h4>

 <h3> ðŸ¤”Personal Reflections and Ideas  </h3>
<h4> I should always be responsible and accomplish the things that I should do well myself.When 
  work in team,dedication to the works is very important to be count as an accountable groupmate.
