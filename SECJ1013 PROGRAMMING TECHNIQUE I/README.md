 <h3> ðŸ“˜ Summarizing What I Have Gained From This </h3>
<h4>Completing this course has equipped me with a solid foundation in programming. Iâ€™ve learned to break down problems using flowcharts and pseudo code, and gained proficiency in data types, control structures, functions, arrays, and pointers. The hands-on assignments and tests helped me apply these concepts in real-world scenarios, improving my coding and debugging skills. This course has strengthened my ability to write efficient, modular code and prepared me to tackle more complex projects in the future. I now feel confident in my programming abilities and ready for the next challenges.
