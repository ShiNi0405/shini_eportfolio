# üëã Hello, I'm Lai Shi Ni

I am a first-year student at the University of Technology Malaysia (UTM) pursuing a **Bachelor of Computer Science (Graphics and Multimedia Software) with Honours**. Before embarking on my academic journey, I gained experience working as a librarian, Nirvana life planner, and digital marketing sales.

As I continue my studies, I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve problems and enhance human interaction. Here are a few highlights of my journey so far:

## üåü Projects

### **Edu-Robot**  
As part of the *Airost Internship Project*, my team developed an AI-powered study aid robot designed to help students stay focused and productive. Key features include:
- Voice recognition and AI responses
- Music and video playback via YouTube
- Hand recognition to control media
- Pomodoro timer tracking
- A feature that detects phones in the view and shouts ‚ÄúPUT YOUR PHONE DOWN‚Äù

I am in charge of building an **API window** that recognizes and understands human voice and produces voice responses using AI. I use Groq Playground to gain API access to the **Llama-3 model** for free. Then, I recognize the human voice using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text (STT) and produce humanoid voice responses using Google Text-to-Speech (TTS). In addition, I use **voice activity detection** to automatically detect 120 ms of silence and end the recording. Lastly, I channeled and connected them using **ROS** node subscription and publication services
