# üëã Hello, I'm Lai Shi Ni

I am a first-year student at the University of Technology Malaysia (UTM) pursuing a **Bachelor of Computer Science (Graphics and Multimedia Software) with Honours**. Before embarking on my academic journey, I gained experience working as a librarian, Nirvana life planner, and digital marketing sales.

As I continue my studies, I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve problems and enhance human interaction. Here are a few highlights of my journey so far:
