My journey
Airost Internship Project
I with my teammates ,team black mamba ,created an edu-robot using ROS1.This is the problem 
statement-As students, we always face a lot of problems in our study. Thus instead of 
studying, our focus is shifted towards typing out questions that we have into a search 
engine hoping to get an answer. Some students who like to listen to music while studying
might find that interacting with their laptops or phones to change volume, skip songs and
selecting songs interferes with their focus, lowering their productivity as a result.We
created an study aid device with features such as:
- Recognizing and understanding human voice, and produce a respond to user through AI
- Able to play songs and videos using youtube 
- Using hand recognition to interact with the music player
- Record Pomodoro sessions
- Detect handphone in the camera view and shout -"PUT YOUR PHONE DOWN"
I am in charge of building an API window that recognize and understand human voice and
produce voice response by AI.I use groq playground to have API access to llama -3 model
freely.Then I recognize the human voice by using google cloud speech to text(STT) and
produce humanoid voice response by using google Text to Speech(TTS).In addition to that,
I use voice activity detection to automatically detect 120 ms of silence and end the
recording.Lastly,I chanelled and connected them using ros node subscription and publication
service.

Robocon 20 day autocar challenge
I joined the two day basic workshop on 25 to 26 October to gain some basic knowledge.Then
I joined the autocar challenge on 3 -23 November and pull it through the whole challenge.
I manage to produce -mainboard and sensor board schematic diagram
- LED toggle with push button configuration
- PCB layout for mainboard and sensor board
- solder all of them together
- a car that is able to follow the Forward and Backward command through UART
