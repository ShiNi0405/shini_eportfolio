 <h3> ðŸ“˜ Summarizing What I Have Gained From This </h3>
<h4>The Digital Logic course provided a solid foundation in Boolean algebra, logic simplification, and combinational
  and sequential circuits. I learned to simplify logical expressions using SOP, POS, and Karnaugh Maps, and gained hands-on 
  experience with basic gates, adders, multiplexers, and decoders. The study of sequential circuits, including latches, 
  flip-flops, and counters, deepened my understanding of memory elements and state management in digital systems. The
  shift register module taught me about data transfer and storage mechanisms.

 <h3>ðŸ’¡Suggestions for Improvement </h3>
<h4>To improve,I should be more focused to the class and alert to what people said.I suggest the lectures could be recorded
  so that students can study later.

<h4>This course  has enhanced my problem-solving skills 
  and my ability to think logically and systematically.The 
  hands on project using deeds is really fun too. </h4>
