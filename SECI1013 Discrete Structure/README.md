 <h3> ðŸ“˜ Summarizing What I Have Gained From This </h3>
<h4>What I have gained from discrete structure class is that the discrete structure is 
  a solid foundation in key mathematical concepts essential for computer science, including set theory, logic, 
  relations, functions, counting methods, probability, and graph theory. The study of graph theory, including Dijkstraâ€™s 
  algorithm and Hamiltonian cycles, was particularly insightful for real-world problem-solving.
</h4>

 <h3>ðŸ’¡Suggestions for Improvement </h3>
<h4>To improve,I should read more and do more exercise for these chapters.I should watch more tutorial videos related to them
  and also some other concepts in this chapter to understand intuitively.I can also open a course to teach other so that
  the knowledge retain more than 75%.I suggest that more coding challenges related to the mathematical concepts discussed 
  would enhance the understanding of their real-world applications.
