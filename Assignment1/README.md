 <h2>ðŸŒŸ Reflection</h2>  
 <h3> ðŸ“˜ Summarizing What I Have Gained From This </h3>
<h4>What I gained is that paper qualifications doesn't matter.One need to has the skills that 
is needed for the job.Now that AI is very advanced,we need to roughly understand the backend
logic behind LLM so that we know when to use it and when not to use it.IT is advancing 
everyday in high speed.It is very fast paced.We need to get ready and prepare from now and 
prepare to have a lifelearning skills because we will never be ready in IT.When we came out
after 4 year we first enter the bachelar degree.The landscape will be completely different
the day the syllabus is structured.That is why we need to be passionate and always looking
forward to learn new technologies from today.</h4>

 <h3>ðŸ’¡Suggestions for Improvement </h3>
<h4>To improve,I suggest that we can have a real time session with the speaker instead of the 
recorded version.Besides ,we can listens more insight from the CTO which is very seasoned
about the real worlds in IT.We can listen the story of his entrepreneurship.How is the IT
landscape in Malaysia</h4>

 <h3> ðŸ¤”Personal Reflections and Ideas  </h3>
<h4>I should start coding and post more on github to increase my competencies. </h4>
